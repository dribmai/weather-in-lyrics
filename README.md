# weather-in-lyrics
The aim of the project is to write a script that will analyze the songs of a given artist in terms of the weather in the places mentioned in their lyrics. 
Having only the name of the band, we need to get the lyrics of all their songs, then look for the names of places in them, and finally check what the weather is like in the places mentioned in the lyric.

I'm realizing this project in Python with use of three differt APIs.
